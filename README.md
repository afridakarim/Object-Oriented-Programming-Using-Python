# Object-Oriented-Programming-Using-Python

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is using objects and their interactions to create various applications and computer programs.

In this tutorial, I will be explaining and demonstrating four principles in object oriented programming. 
These principles are: encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. 



### **Encapsulation:**
Encapsualtion can be understood enclosing something in a capsule. In the case of OOP, this would mean to restrict methods and variables only to one class. These methods and variables cannot be accessed by other classes unless allowed.
